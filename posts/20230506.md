## A Space for Tech Insights and More.

I am excited to announce the launch of my personal blog! While Qoddi App Platform already has an informative <a href="https://blog.qoddi.com">blog</a> focusing on our product, features, and code deployments, I've created this separate space to share a wider variety of content.

This blog will feature insights and opinions on various topics, such as useful pieces of code, innovative products (even from competitors), and other thoughts that may not fit well on other channels. I'm not one to actively post on Twitter or other social networks, and this blog is not about promoting myself or cultivating a public persona. It's simply an avenue for me to share my experiences, ideas, and discoveries with a broader audience.

As someone working in tech in Silicon Valley, with strong ties to France and Canada (Quebec), I'm exposed to different cultures on a daily basis. This offers me unique perspectives on problem-solving and thinking outside the box, which I hope to share with you in my blog posts.

In 2023, the spotlight is on artificial intelligence (AI), and I plan to share my experiences with this revolutionary technology. I'll discuss what AI means for Qoddi's long-term strategy and the surrounding economy.

Currently, we are working on an exciting new chapter for Qoddi: the launch of our GPU line-up to support students, researchers, and individuals who require powerful computing resources to develop apps quickly and efficiently. This includes the training of AI models, which will undoubtedly play a significant role in the future.

I look forward to sharing more on this topic in my second blog post. Stay tuned for further updates and insights on a variety of tech-related subjects!
